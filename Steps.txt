1   Configuration of hibernate.cfg.xml (placing it to resources, if maven.)

2   Maven database driver import (be careful with the versions)

3   Writing the model class to be mapped.

4   Creating data model

    1- This is the model class that Hibernate needs to persist*/

    2- Now we will use annotations to give Hibernate clue*/

    3- Private key assignment

    4- We need an object initialization code.

5   Creating a session factory

6   Making sure that we are using the production cfg.xml rather than generated target cfg.xml.

7   Database generation mode:
    <property name="hbm2ddl.auto">update</property>

8   At database model, primary key generation  method (auto increment) is really important. Check GenerationType Settings.

    @GeneratedValue(strategy= GenerationType.AUTO)
